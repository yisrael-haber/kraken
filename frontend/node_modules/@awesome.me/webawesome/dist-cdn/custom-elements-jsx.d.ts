   * ## Attributes & Properties
   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `name`: The name of the icon to draw. Available names depend on the icon library being used.
   * - `family`: The family of icons to choose from. For Font Awesome Free, valid options include `classic` and `brands`. For
   * Font Awesome Pro subscribers, valid options include, `classic`, `sharp`, `duotone`, `sharp-duotone`, and `brands`.
   * A valid kit code must be present to show pro icons via CDN. You can set `<html data-fa-kit-code="...">` to provide
   * one.
   * - `variant`: The name of the icon's variant. For Font Awesome, valid options include `thin`, `light`, `regular`, and `solid` for
   * the `classic` and `sharp` families. Some variants require a Font Awesome Pro subscription. Custom icon libraries
   * may or may not use this property.
   * - `canvas`: Sets the icon canvas — the box the icon is centered within. Unset renders as `fixed` (1.25em × 1em); `auto` hugs the
   * icon's width; `square` is 1.25em × 1.25em; `roomy` is 1.5em × 1.5em. Mirrors Font Awesome's `fa-fixed-width`,
   * `fa-width-auto`, `fa-canvas-square`, and `fa-canvas-roomy`. Scales with `font-size`.
   * - `auto-width`/`autoWidth`: Sets the width of the icon to match the cropped SVG viewBox. This operates like the Font `fa-width-auto` class.
   * - `swap-opacity`/`swapOpacity`: Swaps the opacity of duotone icons.
   * - `src`: An external URL of an SVG file. Be sure you trust the content you are including, as it will be executed as code and
   * can result in XSS attacks.
   * - `label`: An alternate description to use for assistive devices. If omitted, the icon will be considered presentational and
   * ignored by assistive devices.
   * - `library`: The name of a registered custom icon library.
   * - `rotate`: Sets the rotation degree of the icon
   * - `flip`: Sets the flip direction of the icon along the 'x' (horizontal), 'y' (vertical), or 'both' axes.
   * - `animation`: Sets the animation for the icon
   * - `dir`: undefined
   * - `lang`: undefined
   * - `did-ssr`/`didSSR`: undefined
   * - `initialReflectedProperties`: undefined (property only)
   * - `internals`: undefined (property only)
   *
   * ## Events

   *
   * - `wa-load`: Emitted when the icon has loaded. When using `spriteSheet: true` this will not emit.
   * - `wa-error`: Emitted when the icon fails to load due to an error. When using `spriteSheet: true` this will not emit.

  /**
   *
   *
   * ## Attributes & Properties
   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `anchor`: The element the popup will be anchored to. If the anchor lives outside of the popup, you can provide the anchor
   * element `id`, a DOM element reference, or a `VirtualElement`. If the anchor lives inside the popup, use the
   * `anchor` slot instead.
   * - `active`: Activates the positioning logic and shows the popup. When this attribute is removed, the positioning logic is torn
   * down and the popup will be hidden.
   * - `placement`: The preferred placement of the popup. Note that the actual placement will vary as configured to keep the
   * panel inside of the viewport.
   * - `boundary`: The bounding box to use for flipping, shifting, and auto-sizing.
   * - `distance`: The distance in pixels from which to offset the panel away from its anchor.
   * - `skidding`: The distance in pixels from which to offset the panel along its anchor.
   * - `arrow`: Attaches an arrow to the popup. The arrow's size and color can be customized using the `--arrow-size` and
   * `--arrow-color` custom properties. For additional customizations, you can also target the arrow using
   * `::part(arrow)` in your stylesheet.
   * - `arrow-placement`/`arrowPlacement`: The placement of the arrow. The default is `anchor`, which will align the arrow as close to the center of the
   * anchor as possible, considering available space and `arrow-padding`. A value of `start`, `end`, or `center` will
   * align the arrow to the start, end, or center of the popover instead.
   * - `arrow-padding`/`arrowPadding`: The amount of padding between the arrow and the edges of the popup. If the popup has a border-radius, for example,
   * this will prevent it from overflowing the corners.
   * - `flip`: When set, placement of the popup will flip to the opposite site to keep it in view. You can use
   * `flipFallbackPlacements` to further configure how the fallback placement is determined.
   * - `flip-fallback-placements`/`flipFallbackPlacements`: If the preferred placement doesn't fit, popup will be tested in these fallback placements until one fits. Must be a
   * string of any number of placements separated by a space, e.g. "top bottom left". If no placement fits, the flip
   * fallback strategy will be used instead.
   * - `flip-fallback-strategy`/`flipFallbackStrategy`: When neither the preferred placement nor the fallback placements fit, this value will be used to determine whether
   * the popup should be positioned using the best available fit based on available space or as it was initially
   * preferred.
   * - `flipBoundary`: The flip boundary describes clipping element(s) that overflow will be checked relative to when flipping. By
   * default, the boundary includes overflow ancestors that will cause the element to be clipped. If needed, you can
   * change the boundary by passing a reference to one or more elements to this property.
   * - `flip-padding`/`flipPadding`: The amount of padding, in pixels, to exceed before the flip behavior will occur.
   * - `shift`: Moves the popup along the axis to keep it in view when clipped.
   * - `shiftBoundary`: The shift boundary describes clipping element(s) that overflow will be checked relative to when shifting. By
   * default, the boundary includes overflow ancestors that will cause the element to be clipped. If needed, you can
   * change the boundary by passing a reference to one or more elements to this property.
   * - `shift-padding`/`shiftPadding`: The amount of padding, in pixels, to exceed before the shift behavior will occur.
   * - `auto-size`/`autoSize`: When set, this will cause the popup to automatically resize itself to prevent it from overflowing.
   * - `sync`: Syncs the popup's width or height to that of the anchor element.
   * - `autoSizeBoundary`: The auto-size boundary describes clipping element(s) that overflow will be checked relative to when resizing. By
   * default, the boundary includes overflow ancestors that will cause the element to be clipped. If needed, you can
   * change the boundary by passing a reference to one or more elements to this property.
   * - `auto-size-padding`/`autoSizePadding`: The amount of padding, in pixels, to exceed before the auto-size behavior will occur.
   * - `hover-bridge`/`hoverBridge`: When a gap exists between the anchor and the popup element, this option will add a "hover bridge" that fills the
   * gap using an invisible element. This makes listening for events such as `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` more sane
   * because the pointer never technically leaves the element. The hover bridge will only be drawn when the popover is
   * active.
   * - `dir`: undefined
   * - `lang`: undefined
   * - `did-ssr`/`didSSR`: undefined
   * - `popup`: A reference to the internal popup container. Useful for animating and styling the popup with JavaScript. (property only)
   * - `initialReflectedProperties`: undefined (property only)
   * - `internals`: undefined (property only)
   *
   * ## Events
   *
   * Events that will be emitted by the component.
   *
   * - `wa-reposition`: Emitted when the popup is repositioned. This event can fire a lot, so avoid putting expensive operations in your listener or consider debouncing it.
   *
   * ## Slots
   *
   * Areas where markup can be added to the component.
   *
   * - `(default)`: The popup's content.
   * - `anchor`: The element the popup will be anchored to. If the anchor lives outside of the popup, you can use the `anchor` attribute or property instead.
   *

   *
   * - `reposition() => void`: Forces the popup to recalculate and reposition itself.
   *
   * ## CSS Custom Properties
   *
   * CSS variables available for styling the component.

   * - `--popup-border-width`: The width of any custom border applied to the popup. This is used to reposition the arrow to overlap to the inside edge of the popup border. (default: `undefined`)
   * - `--arrow-color`: The color of the arrow. (default: `black`)
   * - `--auto-size-available-width`: A read-only custom property that determines the amount of width the popup can be before overflowing. Useful for positioning child elements that need to overflow. This property is only available when using `auto-size`. (default: `undefined`)
   * - `--auto-size-available-height`: A read-only custom property that determines the amount of height the popup can be before overflowing. Useful for positioning child elements that need to overflow. This property is only available when using `auto-size`. (default: `undefined`)
   * - `--show-duration`: The show duration to use when applying built-in animation classes. (default: `var(--wa-transition-fast)`)
   * - `--hide-duration`: The hide duration to use when applying built-in animation classes. (default: `var(--wa-transition-fast)`)
   *
   * ## CSS Parts
   *
   * Custom selectors for styling elements within the component.
   *
   * - `arrow`: The arrow's container. Avoid setting `top|bottom|left|right` properties, as these values are assigned dynamically as the popup moves. This is most useful for applying a background color to match the popup, and maybe a border or box shadow.
   * - `popup`: The popup's container. Useful for setting a background color, box shadow, etc.
   * - `hover-bridge`: The hover bridge element. Only available when the `hover-bridge` option is enabled.

   *
   * ## Attributes & Properties
   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `value`/`defaultValue`: The default value. Used to restore the field on form reset. Reflects the `value` HTML attribute.

   * ## Attributes & Properties
   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `view`: The view is a reflection of the "mobileBreakpoint", when the page is larger than the `mobile-breakpoint` (768px by
   * default), it is considered to be a "desktop" view. The view is merely a way to distinguish when to show/hide the
   * navigation. You can use additional media queries to make other adjustments to content as necessary.
   * The default is "desktop" because the "mobile navigation drawer" isn't accessible via SSR due to drawer requiring JS.
   * - `nav-open`/`navOpen`: Whether or not the navigation drawer is open. Note, the navigation drawer is only "open" on mobile views.
   * - `mobile-breakpoint`/`mobileBreakpoint`: At what page width to hide the "navigation" slot and collapse into a hamburger button.

  /**
   *
   *
   * ## Attributes & Properties
   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `anchor`: The element the popup will be anchored to. If the anchor lives outside of the popup, you can provide the anchor
   * element `id`, a DOM element reference, or a `VirtualElement`. If the anchor lives inside the popup, use the
   * `anchor` slot instead.
   * - `active`: Activates the positioning logic and shows the popup. When this attribute is removed, the positioning logic is torn
   * down and the popup will be hidden.
   * - `placement`: The preferred placement of the popup. Note that the actual placement will vary as configured to keep the
   * panel inside of the viewport.
   * - `boundary`: The bounding box to use for flipping, shifting, and auto-sizing.
   * - `distance`: The distance in pixels from which to offset the panel away from its anchor.
   * - `skidding`: The distance in pixels from which to offset the panel along its anchor.
   * - `arrow`: Attaches an arrow to the popup. The arrow's size and color can be customized using the `--arrow-size` and
   * `--arrow-color` custom properties. For additional customizations, you can also target the arrow using
   * `::part(arrow)` in your stylesheet.
   * - `arrow-placement`/`arrowPlacement`: The placement of the arrow. The default is `anchor`, which will align the arrow as close to the center of the
   * anchor as possible, considering available space and `arrow-padding`. A value of `start`, `end`, or `center` will
   * align the arrow to the start, end, or center of the popover instead.
   * - `arrow-padding`/`arrowPadding`: The amount of padding between the arrow and the edges of the popup. If the popup has a border-radius, for example,
   * this will prevent it from overflowing the corners.
   * - `flip`: When set, placement of the popup will flip to the opposite site to keep it in view. You can use
   * `flipFallbackPlacements` to further configure how the fallback placement is determined.
   * - `flip-fallback-placements`/`flipFallbackPlacements`: If the preferred placement doesn't fit, popup will be tested in these fallback placements until one fits. Must be a
   * string of any number of placements separated by a space, e.g. "top bottom left". If no placement fits, the flip
   * fallback strategy will be used instead.
   * - `flip-fallback-strategy`/`flipFallbackStrategy`: When neither the preferred placement nor the fallback placements fit, this value will be used to determine whether
   * the popup should be positioned using the best available fit based on available space or as it was initially
   * preferred.
   * - `flipBoundary`: The flip boundary describes clipping element(s) that overflow will be checked relative to when flipping. By
   * default, the boundary includes overflow ancestors that will cause the element to be clipped. If needed, you can
   * change the boundary by passing a reference to one or more elements to this property.
   * - `flip-padding`/`flipPadding`: The amount of padding, in pixels, to exceed before the flip behavior will occur.
   * - `shift`: Moves the popup along the axis to keep it in view when clipped.
   * - `shiftBoundary`: The shift boundary describes clipping element(s) that overflow will be checked relative to when shifting. By
   * default, the boundary includes overflow ancestors that will cause the element to be clipped. If needed, you can
   * change the boundary by passing a reference to one or more elements to this property.
   * - `shift-padding`/`shiftPadding`: The amount of padding, in pixels, to exceed before the shift behavior will occur.
   * - `auto-size`/`autoSize`: When set, this will cause the popup to automatically resize itself to prevent it from overflowing.
   * - `sync`: Syncs the popup's width or height to that of the anchor element.
   * - `autoSizeBoundary`: The auto-size boundary describes clipping element(s) that overflow will be checked relative to when resizing. By
   * default, the boundary includes overflow ancestors that will cause the element to be clipped. If needed, you can
   * change the boundary by passing a reference to one or more elements to this property.
   * - `auto-size-padding`/`autoSizePadding`: The amount of padding, in pixels, to exceed before the auto-size behavior will occur.
   * - `hover-bridge`/`hoverBridge`: When a gap exists between the anchor and the popup element, this option will add a "hover bridge" that fills the
   * gap using an invisible element. This makes listening for events such as `mouseenter` and `mouseleave` more sane
   * because the pointer never technically leaves the element. The hover bridge will only be drawn when the popover is
   * active.
   * - `dir`: undefined
   * - `lang`: undefined
   * - `did-ssr`/`didSSR`: undefined
   * - `popup`: A reference to the internal popup container. Useful for animating and styling the popup with JavaScript. (property only)
   * - `initialReflectedProperties`: undefined (property only)
   * - `internals`: undefined (property only)
   *
   * ## Events
   *
   * Events that will be emitted by the component.
   *
   * - `wa-reposition`: Emitted when the popup is repositioned. This event can fire a lot, so avoid putting expensive operations in your listener or consider debouncing it.
   *
   * ## Slots
   *
   * Areas where markup can be added to the component.
   *
   * - `(default)`: The popup's content.
   * - `anchor`: The element the popup will be anchored to. If the anchor lives outside of the popup, you can use the `anchor` attribute or property instead.
   *
   * ## Methods
   *
   * Methods that can be called to access component functionality.
   *
   * - `reposition() => void`: Forces the popup to recalculate and reposition itself.
   *
   * ## CSS Custom Properties
   *
   * CSS variables available for styling the component.
   *
   * - `--arrow-size`: The size of the arrow. Note that an arrow won't be shown unless the `arrow` attribute is used. (default: `6px`)
   * - `--popup-border-width`: The width of any custom border applied to the popup. This is used to reposition the arrow to overlap to the inside edge of the popup border. (default: `undefined`)
   * - `--arrow-color`: The color of the arrow. (default: `black`)
   * - `--auto-size-available-width`: A read-only custom property that determines the amount of width the popup can be before overflowing. Useful for positioning child elements that need to overflow. This property is only available when using `auto-size`. (default: `undefined`)
   * - `--auto-size-available-height`: A read-only custom property that determines the amount of height the popup can be before overflowing. Useful for positioning child elements that need to overflow. This property is only available when using `auto-size`. (default: `undefined`)
   * - `--show-duration`: The show duration to use when applying built-in animation classes. (default: `var(--wa-transition-fast)`)
   * - `--hide-duration`: The hide duration to use when applying built-in animation classes. (default: `var(--wa-transition-fast)`)
   *
   * ## CSS Parts
   *
   * Custom selectors for styling elements within the component.
   *
   * - `arrow`: The arrow's container. Avoid setting `top|bottom|left|right` properties, as these values are assigned dynamically as the popup moves. This is most useful for applying a background color to match the popup, and maybe a border or box shadow.
   * - `popup`: The popup's container. Useful for setting a background color, box shadow, etc.
   * - `hover-bridge`: The hover bridge element. Only available when the `hover-bridge` option is enabled.

  /**
   *
   *
   * ## Attributes & Properties
   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `value`/`defaultValue`: The default value of the form control. Primarily used for resetting the form control.
   * - `with-label`/`withLabel`: Only required for SSR. Set to `true` if you're slotting in a `label` element so the server-rendered markup
   * includes the label before the component hydrates on the client.
   * - `with-hint`/`withHint`: Only required for SSR. Set to `true` if you're slotting in a `hint` element so the server-rendered markup
   * includes the hint before the component hydrates on the client.
   * - `label`: The color picker's label. This will not be displayed, but it will be announced by assistive devices. If you need to
   * display HTML, you can use the `label` slot` instead.
   * - `hint`: The color picker's hint. If you need to display HTML, use the `hint` slot instead.
   * - `format`: The format to use. If opacity is enabled, these will translate to HEXA, RGBA, HSLA, and HSVA respectively. The color
   * picker will accept user input in any format (including CSS color names) and convert it to the desired format.
   * - `size`: Determines the size of the color picker's trigger
   * - `placement`: The preferred placement of the color picker's popup. Note that the actual placement will vary as configured to
   * keep the panel inside of the viewport.

   * - `name`: The name of the form control, submitted as a name/value pair with form data.
   * - `disabled`: Disables the color picker.
   * - `open`: Indicates whether or not the popup is open. You can toggle this attribute to show and hide the popup, or you
   * can use the `show()` and `hide()` methods and this attribute will reflect the popup's open state.
   * - `opacity`: Shows the opacity slider. Enabling this will cause the formatted value to be HEXA, RGBA, or HSLA.
   * - `uppercase`: By default, values are lowercase. With this attribute, values will be uppercase instead.
   * - `swatches`: One or more predefined color swatches to display as presets in the color picker. Can include any format the color
   * picker can parse, including HEX(A), RGB(A), HSL(A), HSV(A), and CSS color names. Each color must be separated by a
   * semicolon (`;`). Alternatively, you can pass an array of color values or an array of `{ color, label }` objects to
   * this property using JavaScript. When using objects with labels, the label will be used for the swatch's accessible
   * name instead of the raw color value.
   * - `required`: Makes the color picker a required field.

   * to place the form control outside of a form and associate it with the form that has this `id`. The form must be in
   * the same document or shadow root for this to work. (property only)

   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `value`: The text value to copy.
   * - `from`: An id that references an element in the same document from which data will be copied. If both this and `value` are
   * present, this value will take precedence. By default, the target element's `textContent` will be copied. To copy an
   * attribute, append the attribute name wrapped in square brackets, e.g. `from="el[value]"`. To copy a property,
   * append a dot and the property name, e.g. `from="el.value"`.
   * - `disabled`: Disables the copy button.
   * - `copy-label`/`copyLabel`: A custom label to use as the accessible name and tooltip text in the default copy state.
   * - `success-label`/`successLabel`: A custom label to show in the tooltip after copying.
   * - `error-label`/`errorLabel`: A custom label to show in the tooltip when a copy error occurs.
   * - `feedback-duration`/`feedbackDuration`: The length of time to show feedback before restoring the default trigger.
   * - `tooltip-placement`/`tooltipPlacement`: The preferred placement of the tooltip.
   * - `tooltip`: Controls the built-in tooltip. `full` (default) shows the tooltip on hover and focus and during copy feedback.
   * `copy` keeps the tooltip silent on hover/focus and only shows it briefly to confirm a successful or failed copy.
   * `none` disables the tooltip entirely. Applies to both the default and custom triggers.

   * (e.g. `/partials.html#my-id`). When targeting an element by id, its content is cloned. If the target is a
   * `<template>`, its child nodes are cloned. Be sure you trust the content you are including as it will be executed as
   * code and can result in XSS attacks.
   * - `mode`: The fetch mode to use.

  /**
   *
   *
   * ## Attributes & Properties
   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `value`/`defaultValue`: The default value. Used to restore the field on form reset. Reflects the `value` HTML attribute.
   * - `length`: Number of character segments to display. Overridden by `format` when set.
   * - `appearance`: Visual appearance of the segments.
   * - `type`: Allowed character class.
   * - `mask`: When true, entered characters are displayed as `--mask-char` instead of their real value.
   * - `case`: Case transformation applied to entered characters.
   * - `size`: The size of each segment.
   * - `label`: A label shown above the segments. Use the `label` slot for HTML content.
   * - `hint`: Hint text shown below the segments. Use the `hint` slot for HTML content.

   * Setting `format` overrides `length` (the segment count is derived from the number of `#` characters).
   * - `autocomplete`: The `autocomplete` attribute forwarded to the underlying input.
   * - `required`: Makes the field required. A partially-filled field is always invalid regardless of this attribute.
   * - `readonly`: Makes the field readonly — the value displays but cannot be edited by the user.
   * - `autosubmit`: When true, the form is submitted automatically once all segments are filled.
   * - `autofocus`: Automatically focuses the field when the page loads.
   * - `with-mask`/`withMask`: When true, empty segments show `--mask-char` as a hint instead of appearing blank, similar to
   * how a password field communicates its expected length before anything is typed.
   * - `name`: The name of the input, submitted as a name/value pair with form data.
   * - `disabled`: Disables the form control.
   * - `custom-error`/`customError`: undefined

  /**
   *
   *
   * ## Attributes & Properties
   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `view`: The view is a reflection of the "mobileBreakpoint", when the page is larger than the `mobile-breakpoint` (768px by
   * default), it is considered to be a "desktop" view. The view is merely a way to distinguish when to show/hide the
   * navigation. You can use additional media queries to make other adjustments to content as necessary.
   * The default is "desktop" because the "mobile navigation drawer" isn't accessible via SSR due to drawer requiring JS.
   * - `nav-open`/`navOpen`: Whether or not the navigation drawer is open. Note, the navigation drawer is only "open" on mobile views.
   * - `mobile-breakpoint`/`mobileBreakpoint`: At what page width to hide the "navigation" slot and collapse into a hamburger button.
   * Accepts both numbers (interpreted as px) and CSS lengths (e.g. `50em`), which are resolved based on the root element.
   * - `navigation-placement`/`navigationPlacement`: Where to place the navigation when in the mobile viewport.
   * - `disable-navigation-toggle`/`disableNavigationToggle`: Determines whether or not to hide the default hamburger button.
   * This will automatically flip to "true" if you add an element with `data-toggle-nav` anywhere in the element light DOM.
   * Generally this will be set for you and you don't need to do anything, unless you're using SSR, in which case you should set this manually for initial page loads.
   * - `dir`: undefined
   * - `lang`: undefined
   * - `did-ssr`/`didSSR`: undefined
   * - `header`: undefined (property only)
   * - `menu`: undefined (property only)

   * - `subheader`: A subheader to display below the `header`. This is a good place to put things like breadcrumbs.
   * - `menu`: The left side of the page. If you slot an element in here, you will override the default `navigation` slot and will be handling navigation on your own. This also will not disable the fallback behavior of the navigation button. This section "sticks" to the top as the page scrolls.
   * - `navigation-header`: The header for a navigation area. On mobile this will be the header for `<wa-drawer>`.
   * - `navigation`: The main content to display in the navigation area. This is displayed on the left side of the page, if `menu` is not used. This section "sticks" to the top as the page scrolls.
   * - `navigation-footer`: The footer for a navigation area. On mobile this will be the footer for `<wa-drawer>`.
   * - `navigation-toggle`: Use this slot to slot in your own button + icon for toggling the navigation drawer. By default it is a `<wa-button>` + a 3 bars `<wa-icon>`
   * - `navigation-toggle-icon`: Use this to slot in your own icon for toggling the navigation drawer. By default it is 3 bars `<wa-icon>`.
   * - `main-header`: Header to display inline above the main content.

  /**
   *
   *
   * ## Attributes & Properties
   *
   * Component attributes and properties that can be applied to the element or by using JavaScript.
   *
   * - `total`: The total number of items to paginate.
   * - `page-size`/`pageSize`: The number of items shown per page.
   * - `page`: The current page, starting at 1.
   * - `sibling-count`/`siblingCount`: The number of pages to show on each side of the current page.
   * - `boundary-count`/`boundaryCount`: The number of pages to always show at the start and end.
   * - `without-nav`/`withoutNav`: Hides the previous and next buttons.
   * - `with-edges`/`withEdges`: Shows buttons that jump to the first and last pages.

   * - `format`: The pagination's layout. The default `standard` format shows the full page list with ellipses; `compact` collapses
   * it into a short "1 of 5" label flanked by the previous and next buttons, useful in tight spaces like toolbars and
   * cards.
   * - `href-template`/`hrefTemplate`: A URL template used to render page items as links instead of buttons. When set, items render as `<a>` elements for
   * SSR, SEO, and no-JS support. Provide a string with `{page}` as a placeholder for the page number, e.g.
   * `/products?page={page}`. In JavaScript, you can also assign a function that receives the page number and returns
   * the URL, e.g. `el.hrefTemplate = page => \`/products?page=${page}\``.
   * - `hide-single-page`/`hideSinglePage`: Renders nothing when there's only one page.
   * - `label`: A label that describes the pagination to assistive devices. This won't be shown on the screen, but it will be
