# Switch

`<wa-switch>`

Stable [Forms](https://webawesome.com/docs/components/?category=forms) [Since 2.0](https://webawesome.com/docs/resources/changelog#wa_200)

Switches toggle a single setting on or off and apply the change immediately, without requiring a form submission.

```html
<wa-switch>Enable notifications</wa-switch>
```

This component works with standard `<form>` elements. See [form controls](https://webawesome.com/docs/form-controls) for form submission and client-side validation.

### Slots

| \`form\` | \`

\` By default, form controls are associated with the nearest containing element. This attribute allows you to place the form control outside of a form and associate it with the form that has this id. The form must be in the same document or shadow root for this to work. Type HTMLFormElement \\| null | |
| \`hint\` hint | \`hint\` The switch's . If you need to display HTML, use the hint slot instead. Type string Default '' | |

### Methods

| --- | --- | --- |
| \`blur()\` | Removes focus from the switch. | |
| \`click()\` | Simulates a click on the switch. | |
| \`focus()\` | Sets focus on the switch. | \`options: FocusOptions\` |
| \`formStateRestoreCallback()\` | Called when the browser is trying to restore element’s state to state in which case reason is "restore", or when the browser is trying to fulfill autofill on behalf of user in which case reason is "autocomplete".

| \`resetValidity()\` | Reset validity is a way of removing manual custom errors and native validation. | |
| \`setCustomValidity()\` | Do not use this when creating a "Validator". This is intended for end users of components. We track manually defined custom errors so we don't clear them on accident in our validators. | \`message: string\` |

## Examples

### Label

Add label text as the switch's default content. For labels that contain HTML, slot the markup in directly.

```html
<wa-switch>Subscribe to the newsletter</wa-switch>
```

### Hint

Add descriptive hint to a switch with the `hint` attribute. For hints that contain HTML, use the `hint` slot instead.

```html
<wa-switch hint="You can change this at any time in settings.">Email me about new releases</wa-switch>
```

### Initial Value

Use the `checked` attribute to activate the switch.

```html
<wa-switch checked>Remember this device</wa-switch>
```

**`checked` sets the initial value, not the current state.**  
Consistent with native checkboxes, it doesn't reflect later changes. To toggle the checked state with JavaScript, use the `checked` property instead. To target checked switches with CSS, use the `:state(checked)` selector.

### Disabled

Use the `disabled` attribute to disable the switch.

```html
<wa-switch disabled>Sync over cellular</wa-switch>
```

### Size

Use the `size` attribute to change a switch's size.

```html
<div class="wa-stack">
  <wa-switch size="xs">Extra Small</wa-switch>
  <wa-switch size="s">Small</wa-switch>
  <wa-switch size="m">Medium</wa-switch>
  <wa-switch size="l">Large</wa-switch>
  <wa-switch size="xl">Extra Large</wa-switch>
</div>
```

### Custom Properties

Use the available custom properties to change how the switch is styled.

```html
<wa-switch style="--width: 80px; --height: 40px; --thumb-size: 36px;">Really big</wa-switch>
```
